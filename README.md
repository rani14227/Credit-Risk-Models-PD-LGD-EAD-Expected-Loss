# Credit-Risk-Models-PD-LGD-EAD-Expected-Loss

**We calculate PD,LGD,EAD and Expected loss using logistic and beta regressions.** <br/>

Notebook 1: Training dataset preparation (Feature engineering - Continuous and Discrete dataset)<br/>
Notebook 2: Test dataset preparation<br/>
Notebook 3: Calculate Probability of Default (POD) and Credit score card preparation<br/>
Notebook 4: Monitor the POD model <br/>
Notebook 5: Calculate LGD (Loss given dataset) and EAD (Exposure at Default)for individual customers<br/>
Notebook 6: Compute Expected Loss for individual customers<br/>
